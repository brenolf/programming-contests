# Programming Problems

Here are some of my codes I used to solve (mostly) online judges problems. Not all of them actually do solve the problem, but definitely most do. I have been working on them since I started my BSc degree in Computer Science back in 2011. 

Perhaps you will find other programs not directly related to programming contests; However, they are here because I also find them somehow interesting.

I tried to name each folder after the problem name (but unfortunately I have been a little bit lazy).

## Usage

You may freely use/copy/share these codes. Nevertheless, bear in mind that the most important is the logic behind each problem. The problems were taken from the following sources.

1. [Spoj Brasil](http://br.spoj.com/)
2. [Sphere Online Judge](http://www.spoj.com/)
3. [URI Online Judge](http://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/)
4. [UVA Online Judge](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/)
